# The task

Fully self-contained seed data is provided (no BigQuery, no external warehouse):

- `raw_customers.csv` (400), `raw_orders.csv` (5,000), `raw_payments.csv` (3,376)

Build a **dbt project** (DuckDB or Postgres adapter — both run locally) with:

1. **Staging models** for the three sources.
2. A **marts** model `customer_orders` with exactly these columns:
   `customer_id, customer_name, n_orders, total_amount, first_order_date,
   most_recent_order_date`, where an "order" counts only if its status is
   `completed` or `shipped`, `total_amount` sums that order's payments, and
   customers with zero qualifying orders are excluded.
3. At least one model materialized **`incremental`**, and it must be
   demonstrably faster on re-run than a full refresh.
4. **dbt tests** (e.g. `unique`, `not_null`, relationships) that pass.
5. A **source freshness** config.
6. The whole thing wired into **Airflow or Dagster** (in Docker), including one
   deliberately **flaky task** that fails once and is **retried** to success.

## What to submit

- Your dbt project (in the repo).
- `submission/customer_orders.csv` — your built mart exported to CSV. **This is
  the deterministic check** — it must match the expected table exactly.
- `submission/orchestrator_log.txt` — orchestrator output showing the flaky task
  fail → retry → succeed.
- `submission/NOTES.md` — how you made the model incremental, and the re-run
  timing before/after.

## Grading

An automated grader checks the mart against the expected output (deterministic), the incremental
materialization and freshness config (if you point it at your dbt project), and
the retry tes
